# 🐳 Simple Microservice with Docker 🐋

Welcome to the **Simple Microservice Docker** repository! This project demonstrates a basic microservice architecture using Docker. It is designed to help you understand how to containerize a simple microservice and deploy it with Docker.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Simple microservice in Go
- 🐋 Dockerized microservice
- 🌐 Easy-to-deploy and run in any environment
- 🔧 Scalable and modular structure for real-world applications

## 📦 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- 🐳 [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (version 19.03 or above)
- ⚙️ [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (optional but recommended for managing multiple containers)

## 🛠️ Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
     git clone https://github.com/abdullahalsazib/simple_microservice_docker.git
     cd simple_microservice_docker
```

### 2. Build the Docker Image

To build the Docker image for the microservice, run:

```bash
     docker build -t simple-microservice .
```

### 3. Run the Docker Container

Start the container using the following command:

```bash
     docker run -p 8080:8080 simple-microservice
```

You can access the microservice at http://localhost:8080.

## 🧑‍💻 How it Works

The microservice is built using Go.
The Dockerfile defines how to build the image and run the application.
Docker Compose (if used) will orchestrate multiple services for more complex architectures.
